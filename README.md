# Multi-object-datasets
This is the multi-target dataset for the multi-target recognition situation, which includes a Dog and cat multi-target dataset and a PASCAL VOC 2012 multi-target dataset.

The dog and cat dataset consists of 70 images with both cat and dog presenting in each image. We collected this dataset via Google and labelled key objects in these images.

The PASCAL VOC 2012 multi-target dataset is a subset of PASCAL VOC 2012 data set[1]. It has 1053 test images by selecting all the multi-object images from the PASCAL VOC 2012 validation set.
